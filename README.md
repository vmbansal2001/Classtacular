# Classtacular
Our project helps students to keep a track of their attendance and manage their notes efficiently 
with the help of an android application. It aims to create a helpful platform for all students.
Our app basically provides 3 functionalities: 

* **The Attendance Manager**
* **Notes Area**
* **TimeTable Manager**

The app has an integrated Attendance Manager which displays attendance records in a graphical manner which looks appealing, easy to look at &amp; 
convenient to track your attendance. 
The upload notes area provides for easy upload of notes by users, and also allows the users to share notes amongst themselves (specially for IPU Students using NotesHub Platform). The TimeTable Manager allows the user to upload their timetable. Our app is student friendly and everyone ranging from school to university students can make use of it.

The era of COVID-19 has forced educational institutions to quickly adapt to the new normal. 
With students being required to stay at home, remote learning classes have emerged as the best way to continue education during these unprecedented times. 
One of the biggest challenges that students face with this new format is tracking attendance and keeping their notes intact.
Our project aims to create a helpful platform for all school and university students to solve this problem with the help of an android application.

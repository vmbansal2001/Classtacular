Our project helps students to keep a track of their attendance and manage their notes efficiently 
with the help of an android application. It aims to create a helpful platform for all students.
Our app basically provides 3 functionalities: The Attendance Manager, Notes Area &amp; TimeTable Manager, all at once. 
The app has an integrated Attendance Manager which displays attendance records in a graphical manner which looks appealing, easy to look at &amp; 
convenient to track your attendance. 
The upload notes area provides for easy upload of notes by users, and also allows the users to share notes amongst themselves (specially for IPU Students using NotesHub Platform). The TimeTable Manager allows the user to upload the image of timetable. Our app is student friendly and everyone ranging from school to university students can make use of it. LOL :)

The era of COVID-19 has forced educational institutions to quickly adapt to the new normal. 
With students being required to stay at home, remote learning classes have emerged as the best way to continue education during these unprecedented times. 
One of the biggest challenges that students face with this new format is tracking attendance and keeping their notes intact.
Our project aims to create a helpful platform for all school and university students to solve this problem with the help of an android application.


Our app CLASSTACULAR basically provides 3 fuctionalities:

The Attendance Tracker
The Notes Area
TimeTable Manager

- ATTENDANCE tab opens up an area where we first need to select a subject in which we want to record our attendance. 
  Then we will have an option to mark our daily attendance, this will eventually record our 
  subject wise attendance in percentage format on the basis of which we can further choose to attend or miss classes while not being short of attendance in any subject.
  
- THE NOTES AREA will help us in keeping all our notes organized at one place. 
  ADD NOTES tab opens up an area where we can select our branch, semester, subject, course and add our files subject wise.
  NOTESHUB tab directly takes us to another page with the help of a link where we can access all the prestored notes semester wise.

- TimeTable Manager requires us to upload a photograph of our timetable directly from the storage memory.
  This feature helps to keep track of our upcoming classes with ease.
